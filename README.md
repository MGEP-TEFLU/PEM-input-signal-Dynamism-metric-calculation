# PEM-input-signal-Dynamism-metric-calculation
The code we propose in this repository calculates a Dynamism metric for input signals of PEM electrolysers. The Dynamism metric can also assist on both the definition of the experimental campaign and the transfer of the experimental accelerated results into the real conditions.
